# MO-SMAC

MO-SMAC is implemented directly into SMAC3. This repository is forked from the [SMAC3 repository](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3) and therefore contains references and copyright information to those authors. 
These do not align with the authors of MO-SMAC and therefor the anonymity for this repository remains intact.

## Installation

Create a new environment with Python 3.10 and make sure swig is installed either on your system or
inside the environment. We demonstrate the installation via anaconda in the following:

Create and activate environment:
```
conda create -n SMAC python=3.10
conda activate SMAC
```

Install swig:
```
conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64 swig
```

Clone this repository and install locally:
```
cd SMAC3
pip install -e .[dev]
```


## Minimal Example
To use MO-SMAC, there is a multi-objective facade that provides all the functionalities for MO-AAC. The example below shows how this facade can be accessed and used. 

```py
from ConfigSpace import Configuration, ConfigurationSpace

import time 
import numpy as np
from smac.facade.multi_objective_facade import MultiObjectiveFacade
from smac import Scenario
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

iris = datasets.load_iris()


def train(config: Configuration, seed: int = 0) -> float:
    classifier = SVC(C=config["C"], random_state=seed)
    start_time = time.time()
    scores = cross_val_score(classifier, iris.data, iris.target, cv=5)
    run_time = time.time() - start_time
    return {"perf": 1 - np.mean(scores), "runtime": run_time}


configspace = ConfigurationSpace({"C": (0.100, 1000.0)})

# Scenario object specifying the optimization environment
scenario = Scenario(configspace, 
                    deterministic=True, 
                    n_trials=200,
                    objectives=["perf", "runtime"])

# Use SMAC to find the best configuration/hyperparameters
smac = MultiObjectiveFacade(scenario, train)
incumbent = smac.optimize()
```
